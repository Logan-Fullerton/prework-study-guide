Boot Camp Prework Study Guide

Created a study guide webpage for UC Davis coding bootcamp
-I wanted to create a page that would display what I have learned in the pre-work assignments 
-This project will help me in the future as a reference to the basics I learned during the pre-work assignments

## installation
N/A


## Usage
The webpage displays the 4 topics covered in the pre-work, with notes for each topic listed below. If we open the DevTools and select console, we can see the JavaSCript randomly select one of the topics to study first
